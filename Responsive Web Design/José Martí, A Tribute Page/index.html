                        <li><strong>1876</strong> - In opposition to the <em>Plan de Tuxtepec</em>, proclaimed by General Porfirio Díaz, Martí began collaborating with the newspaper <em>El Socialista</em>, favorable to Lerdo de Tejada's government.

                        <li><strong>1877</strong> - In Guatemala, he was invited to General Garcia Granados' gatherings and fell in love with Maria, the Guatemalan president's daughter. Being already engaged to Carmen Zayas Bazán, Martí couldn't act on his love for María, who died in 1878 of lung disease, shortly after learning that Martí had married. For her, he wrote his 1891 poem <em>La Niña de Guatemala</em></li>
                        <li><strong>1878</strong> - Martí returned to Cuba, where he signed the Pact of Zanjón which ended the Cuban Ten Years' War. There, he married Carmen Zayas Bazán, before plunging into radical efforts</li>
                        <li><strong>1881</strong> - After a brief stay in New York, Martí travelled to Caracas, Venezuela, where he founded the <em>Revista Venezolana</em>.

He also served as a consul for Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay</li>
                        <li><strong>1891</strong> - His essay <em>Nuestra America</em> was published in New York's <em>Revista Ilustrada</em>. In New York, he actively participated in the <em>Conferencia Monetaria Internacional</em></li>

                        <li><strong>1893</strong> - After having travelled through the United States, Central America and the West Indies, to promote his cause and collect funds, Martí had an interview with Máximo Gómez with whom he planned the uprising, before meeting General Antonio Maceo Grajales</li>
